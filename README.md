# Customer Campaign Response – BI Project

This project explores customer response to a marketing campaign using real-world business intelligence tools and techniques. The goal is to identify which customer characteristics are most strongly associated with a positive response and higher spending.

## 📊 Business Goal
Determine what kinds of customers are most likely to respond to a marketing campaign — and how much they typically spend.

## 🧩 Data Source
- **Dataset**: Marketing Customer Value Analysis (Kaggle)
- Includes demographics, product spend, and response data

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- PySpark
- Seaborn + Matplotlib
- JupyterLab in VS Code

## 🔁 Workflow
- Load and clean data in Spark
- Create new features like total spend and customer tenure
- Group and aggregate using OLAP-style operations
- Visualize insights with bar charts, heatmaps, box plots, and a donut chart

## 📈 Key Insights
- Responders tend to be single, higher income, and more highly educated
- They spend nearly twice as much as non-responders on average
- Response rate overall was low (~15%), but high-value groups stood out

## ✅ Suggested Business Action
Focus marketing efforts on high-income, well-educated, single customers.  
They’re more likely to respond and deliver higher ROI.

## ⚠️ Ethical Considerations
Targeting based on personal attributes like income or marital status can cross into profiling. Use with care and transparency.
